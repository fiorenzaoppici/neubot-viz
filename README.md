**Neubot-viz**
==========
Neubot-viz is a client-side webapp conceived for presenting Neubot historical data in a clear and user-friendly way. Up to now, Neubot-viz provides a timeline view of Neubot data within a customizable timespan. Neubot-viz is a collection of javascript files that rely on jQuery.js and d3.js frameworks. In a future implementation, it will rely also on Google javascript APIs for BigQuery, since Neubot data have recently been stored as BigQuery datasets maintained by the M-Lab platform.

Neubot-viz was developed by Fiorenza Oppici. For any issues, contact me at ``fiorenza.oppici [at] studenti.polito.it`` or use the Neubot mailing list at http://www.neubot.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/neubot.
